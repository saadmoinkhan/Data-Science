# Profitable App to Launch based on Data Analysis
Our aim in this project is to identify competitive mobile device profiles for both the App Store and Google Play markets. Our job is to make data-driven decisions about the kind of applications that a team of developers need to create.

We are focussing on free apps, which generate revenue from in-app ads. This means that our income for any particular app depends mainly on the number of users using the application. Our mission is to evaluate data and help our developers recognize what sort of apps more consumers are likely to use.
